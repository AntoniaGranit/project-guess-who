# Project Guess Who

This is a game of Guess Who using Javascript. 


## The problem

I found this project particularly difficult to wrap my head around, because of the amount of steps and functions representing every step and aspect of the game. I went about trying to understand it by looking at every function, commenting what each line of code did and that way mapping out the reasoning behind the code. At the end I added some sound effects and changed the styling a bit, but I'm planning on changing it more in the coming weeks.
